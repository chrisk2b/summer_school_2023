# Summer School 2023
This repository contains all relevant material for the first tutorial session.
You only need the material in this repository and a Google [Colab environment](https://colab.research.google.com/).


This repository contains code and data for three different use cases: 

 - adverse event detection
 -   protein classification
 - diabetes detection

You need to have git installed on your local machine, cf. the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Structure of the Repo

The repository is structured as follows and you will find the following folders on the root level of the repository:

- `adverse_events`: This folder contains code and data related to adverse event detection.
- `protein_classification`: This folder contains code and data related to protein classification.
- `diabetes_detection`: This folder contains code and data related to diabetes detection.

Each of these folders has its own dedicated `README.md` file that provides detailed instructions on how to use the provided data for the respective use cases.
The notebooks in the folders mentioned above contain a potential solution. Pleas use them only if you don't know how to start. Rather, upload the respective
data in the use case folders to the Colab environment and try to fulfill the task by using the data only.

## How to Use

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine by executing:
2. ```git clone https://github.com/chrisk2b/summer_school_2023.git```
3. Explore the different folders based on your interests. For a start, we recommend focusing on the adverse event use case [here](https://github.com/chrisk2b/summer_school_2023/tree/main/adverse_events).
4. Inside the [adverse_events](https://github.com/chrisk2b/summer_school_2023/tree/main/adverse_events) folder, you will find a dedicated [README file](https://github.com/chrisk2b/summer_school_2023/blob/main/adverse_events/README.md) (`README.md`) that provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the code and data for adverse event detection. Follow the instructions in that file to get started.

4. Once you are familiar with the adverse event use case, feel free to explore the other folders (`protein_classification` and `diabetes_detection`) to learn about the other use cases.
